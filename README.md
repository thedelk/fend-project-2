## Instructions

A modern look at the classic memory game!

To get started, open [the GitHub pages site for this repo](https://thedelk.github.io/fend-project-2/) and start clicking on squares!

A star will be deducted after so many failed matches, so strain that brain!

* 15 Moves
* 20 Moves

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository was built off of the start code and heavily modified _(to be honest, having to build off of naming and styling conventions others have started kind of throws me off!)_.  I don't foresee this needing collaborative effort, so pull requests will probably be denied, but feel free to fork or clone if you wish!

There is a [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), but you won't find anything there!
